Data Structures in Java
=======================

I've created this repository to practice common data structures using Java. I will be implementing each of them, including linked lists, stacks, queues, binary trees, and hash tables.

Linked List Implementation
--------------------------

Currently, the only implementation completed is the linked list. You will find this in the root of the repository and contains three files, <code>LinkedList.java</code>, <code>LinkedListIterator.java</code>, and <code>Main.java</code>.

The <code>LinkedListIterator.java</code> file contains two classes, LinkedListIterator and Node. The Node class contains the structure for the nodes in the linked list, while the LinkedListIterator class handles keeping track of the current node being operated on in a List.

The <code>LinkedList.java</code> file contains the LinkedList class, and contains the data needed for the linked list as well as the operations to be performed on the list, such as inserting, deleting, searching, and printing out the list.

The <code>Main.java</code> file is the main driver for the application, and gives some example usage of the classes. It shows inserting, deleting, searching, and printing from the lists, including inserting a list into another list and retrieving the data.
